## Getting into your VMs

Open your browser and go to https://class.hypertheory-labs.com/guacamole

At the Guacamole login screen, use your `studentX` username (with X being your student number)
and the password is `Hypertheory_Training!`.

At the **black** login screen, use just `student` for the username (no number) and the password you changed yesterday.
Leave the domain blank.

**Let Me Know if You Need Help**

> **Once you are in your VM please start Docker Desktop.**
